# Relearn
After about 10 years without writing code, I realized that I didn't need to update my knowledge, I needed to relearn a lot of stuff!

This project will be a collection of C++ experiments and learning exercises. Here I'll develop examples to exercise concepts covered in books or articles that will be used on this journey as well as solutions for some tests I happen to stumble upon.
